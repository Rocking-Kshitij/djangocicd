This project consists of a CRUD django application along with postgresql database.
Set up Github actions and it is completely working.
Github CICD runs on locally hosted action runner and automatically dockerizes the application, sets up environment using docker compose, perfoms tests using python and then stops and deletes temporary containers.
CRUD application is related to a Mini Finance application using Django as backend.
